	abstract = {The {GERDA} experiment searches for the lepton-number-violating neutrinoless double-ùõΩ decay of 76Ge (76Ge‚Üí76Se+2‚Å¢ùëí‚àí) operating bare Ge diodes with an enriched 76Ge fraction in liquid argon. The exposure for broad-energy germanium type ({BEGe}) detectors is increased threefold with respect to our previous data release. The {BEGe} detectors feature an excellent background suppression from the analysis of the time profile of the detector signals. In the analysis window a background level of 1.‚Å¢0+0.6‚àí0.4√ó10‚àí3 counts/({keV} kg yr) has been achieved; if normalized to the energy resolution this is the lowest ever achieved in any 0‚Å¢ŒΩ‚Å¢ùõΩ‚Å¢ùõΩ experiment. No signal is observed and a new 90\% C.L. lower limit for the half-life of 8.0√ó1025 yr is placed when combining with our previous data. The expected median sensitivity assuming no signal is 5.8√ó1025 yr.},

	abstract = {In the search for a monochromatic peak as the signature of neutrinoless double beta decay an excellent energy resolution and an ultra-low background around the Q-value of the decay are essential. The {LEGEND}-200 experiment performs such a search with high-purity germanium detectors enriched in 76Ge immersed in liquid argon. To determine and monitor the stability of the energy scale and resolution of the germanium diodes, custom-made, low-neutron emission 228Th sources are regularly deployed in the vicinity of the crystals. Here we describe the production process of the 17 sources available for installation in the experiment, the measurements of their alpha- and gamma- activities, as well as the determination of the neutron emission rates with a low-background {LiI}(Eu) detector operated deep underground. With a flux of ( 4.27 ¬± 0.60stat ¬± 0.92syst) √ó 10-4 n / ({kBq}¬∑s), approximately one order of magnitude below that of commercial sources, the neutron-induced background rate, mainly from the activation of 76Ge, is negligible compared to other background sources in {LEGEND}-200.},

The experiment consisted of 58 germanium detectors housed in a low background shield and was calibrated once per week by deploying a 228Th line source for 1 to 2 hours. The energy scale calibration determination for the detector array was automated using custom analysis tools.

Both the energy reconstruction and resolution of the germanium detectors are crucial to separate a potential signal from various backgrounds, such as neutrino-accompanied double-\$\${\textbackslash}beta \$\$decays allowed by the Standard Model. The energy resolution and stability were determined and monitored as a function of time using data from regular \$\${\textasciicircum}\{228\}\$\$Th calibrations.

The Majorana Demonstrator is an array of germanium detectors deployed with the aim of implementing background reduction techniques suitable for a 1-ton¬†76Ge-based search. The ultra low-background conditions require regular calibrations to verify proper function of the detectors. Radioactive line sources can be deployed around the cryostats containing the detectors for regular energy calibrations. When measuring in low-background mode, these line sources have to be stored outside the shielding so they do not contribute to the background. The deployment and the retraction of the source are designed to be controlled by the data acquisition system and do not require any direct human interaction. In this paper, we detail the design requirements and implementation of the calibration apparatus, which provides the event rates needed to define the pulse-shape cuts and energy calibration used in the final analysis as well as data that can be compared to simulations.},

	abstract = {The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay (0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤) would show that lepton number is violated, reveal that neu-trinos are Majorana particles, and provide information on neutrino mass. A discovery-capable experiment covering the inverted ordering region, with effective Majorana neutrino masses of 15 ‚àí 50 {meV}, will require a tonne-scale experiment with excellent energy resolution and extremely low backgrounds, at the level of ‚àº0.1 count /({FWHM}¬∑t¬∑yr) in the region of the signal. The current generation 76Ge experiments {GERDA} and the Majorana Demonstrator, utilizing high purity Germanium detectors with an intrinsic energy resolution of 0.12\%, have achieved the lowest backgrounds by over an order of magnitude in the 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ signal region of all 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ experiments. Building on this success, the {LEGEND} collaboration has been formed to pursue a tonne-scale 76Ge experiment. The collaboration aims to develop a phased 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ experimental program with discovery potential at a half-life approaching or at 1028 years, using existing resources as appropriate to expedite physics results.},

	abstract = {The trapping-detrapping behaviour of Ge(Li) and Si(Li) detectors at low temperatures (T{\textless}77K) has been quantitatively analyzed by means of the phenomenological theory published by J.W. Mayer1). The conclusion has been reached that the trapping centres are the primary dopants: Li and Ga in Ge(Li) detectors, Li and B in Si(Li) detectors. Normal spectrometer operation is not affected by these shallow traps because their small activation energies result in very fast detrapping at T‚©æ77 K. A field assisted detrapping effect has been identified for the first time in Ge. This effect allows good spectrometer performance down to at least 8 K at high electric fields. No such field detrapping effect was observed in Si(Li) detectors, so the low temperature limit of operation is established at ‚âà 50 K by the thermal re-emission of carriers from the shallow traps. Deep trapping effects at 77 K in Ge(Li) detectors have also been briefly investigated. A probable explanation is offered for the observed improvement in performance of many detectors at high electric fields. The values of the measured capture cross-sections for trapping of the carriers by the ionized dopants in Ge and Si fall in the same range as those in the literature. This demonstrates the potential of lithium-drifted devices for the study of these processes.},

The excellent energy resolution, the negligible intrinsic radioactive contamination, the possibility of enriching the crystals up to 88\% in the 76Ge isotope as well as the high detection efficiency, are all key ingredients for highly sensitive 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ decay search. The Majorana and Gerda experiments successfully implemented the use of germanium (Ge) semiconductor detectors, reaching an energy resolution of 2.53 ¬± 0.08 {keV} at the QŒ≤Œ≤ and an unprecedented low background level of 5.2√ó10‚àí4 cts/({keV}¬∑kg¬∑yr), respectively.

	abstract = {An analysis of solar neutrino data from the fourth phase of Super-Kamiokande ({SK}-{IV}) from October 2008 to May 2018 is performed and the results are presented. The observation time of the dataset of {SK}-{IV} corresponds to 2970¬†days and the total live time for all four phases is 5805¬†days. For more precise solar neutrino measurements, several improvements are applied in this analysis: lowering the data acquisition threshold in May 2015, further reduction of the spallation background using neutron clustering events, precise energy reconstruction considering the time variation of the {PMT} gain. The observed number of solar neutrino events in 3.49‚Äì19.49¬†{MeV} electron kinetic energy region during {SK}-{IV} is

	abstract = {The recent long-term shutdown of Japanese nuclear reactors has resulted in a significantly reduced reactor ‚Äæùúàùëí flux at {KamLAND}. This running condition provides a unique opportunity to confirm and constrain backgrounds for the reactor ‚Äæùúàùëí oscillation analysis. The data set also has improved sensitivity for other ‚Äæùúàùëí signals, in particular ‚Äæùúàùëí‚Äôs produced in ùõΩ-decays from 238U and 232Th within the Earth‚Äôs interior, whose energy spectrum overlaps with that of reactor ‚Äæùúàùëí‚Äôs. Including constraints on ùúÉ13 from accelerator and short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments, a combined three-flavor analysis of solar and {KamLAND} data gives fit values for the oscillation parameters of tan 2‚Å¢ùúÉ12 =0.436+0.029‚àí0.025, ùõ•‚Å¢ùëö221 =7.53+0.18‚àí0.18 √ó10‚àí5 {eV}2, and sin 2‚Å¢ùúÉ13 =0.023+0.002‚àí0.002. Assuming a chondritic Th/U mass ratio, we obtain 116+28‚àí27 ‚Äæùúàùëí events from 238U and 232Th, corresponding to a geo ‚Äæùúàùëí flux of 3.4+0.8‚àí0.8 √ó106 cm‚àí2 s‚àí1 at the {KamLAND} location. We evaluate various bulk silicate Earth composition models using the observed geo ‚Äæùúàùëí rate.},

Thus, neutrinoless double-Œ≤ decay, in which the total lepton number is violated by two units, is a probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. In this review we consider the basic mechanism of neutrinoless double-Œ≤ decay induced by light Majorana neutrino masses. After a brief summary of the present status of our knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing and an introduction to the seesaw mechanism for the generation of light Majorana neutrino masses, in this review we discuss the theory and phenomenology of neutrinoless double-Œ≤ decay. We present the basic elements of the theory of neutrinoless double-Œ≤ decay, our view of the present status of the challenging problem of the calculation of the nuclear matrix element of the process and a summary of the experimental results.},

It is also shown that it is impossible to construct a Fock space of weak states. However, neutrino oscillations can be described by defining appropriate ‚Äò‚Äòweak-process states,‚Äô‚Äô which are superpositions of mass eigenstates weighted by their transition amplitudes in the process under consideration. In the extreme relativistic limit, the weak-process states reduce to the usual weak states.

	abstract = {The possibility that neutrinos may be their own antiparticles, unique among the known fundamental particles, arises from the symmetric theory of fermions proposed by Ettore Majorana in 19371. Given the profound consequences of such Majorana neutrinos, among which is a potential explanation for the matter‚Äìantimatter asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis2, the Majorana nature of neutrinos commands intense experimental scrutiny globally; one of the primary experimental probes is neutrinoless double beta (0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤) decay. Here we show results from the search for 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ decay of 130Te, using the latest advanced cryogenic calorimeters with the {CUORE} experiment3. {CUORE}, operating just 10‚Äâmillikelvin above absolute zero, has pushed the state of the art on three frontiers: the sheer mass held at such ultralow temperatures, operational longevity, and the low levels of ionizing radiation emanating from the cryogenic infrastructure. We find no evidence for 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ decay and set a lower bound of the process half-life as 2.2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ1025‚Äâyears at a 90‚Äâper‚Äâcent credibility interval. We discuss potential applications of the advances made with {CUORE} to other fields such as direct dark matter, neutrino and nuclear physics searches and large-scale quantum computing, which can benefit from sustained operation of large payloads in a low-radioactivity, ultralow-temperature cryogenic environment.},

By operating bare germanium diodes, enriched in 76Ge, in an active liquid argon shield, {GERDA} achieved an unprecedently low background index of 5.2√ó10‚àí4 counts/({keV} kg yr) in the signal region and met the design goal to collect an exposure of 100 kg yr in a background-free regime. When combined with the result of Phase I, no signal is observed after 127.2 kg yr of total exposure. A limit on the half-life of 0‚Å¢ùúà‚Å¢ùõΩ‚Å¢ùõΩ decay in 76Ge is set at ùëá1/2 {\textgreater}1.8 √ó1026 yr at 90\% C.L., which coincides with the sensitivity assuming no signal.},

	abstract = {We propose the construction of {LEGEND}-1000, the ton-scale Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}beta\$ Decay. This international experiment is designed to answer one of the highest priority questions in fundamental physics. It consists of 1000 kg of Ge detectors enriched to more than 90\% in the \${\textasciicircum}\{76\}\$Ge isotope operated in a liquid argon active shield at a deep underground laboratory. By combining the lowest background levels with the best energy resolution in the field, {LEGEND}-1000 will perform a quasi-background-free search and can make an unambiguous discovery of neutrinoless double-beta decay with just a handful of counts at the decay \$Q\$ value. The experiment is designed to probe this decay with a 99.7\%-{CL} discovery sensitivity in the \${\textasciicircum}\{76\}\$Ge half-life of \$1.3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{28\}\$ years, corresponding to an effective Majorana mass upper limit in the range of 9-21 {meV}, to cover the inverted-ordering neutrino mass scale with 10 yr of live time.},

In particular, we contextualize the 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ in the panorama of lepton number violating processes, also assessing some possible particle physics mechanisms mediating the process. Since the 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ existence is correlated with neutrino masses, we also review the state of the art of the theoretical understanding of neutrino masses. In the final part, the status of current 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ experiments is presented and the prospects for the future hunt for 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ are discussed. Also, experimental data coming from cosmological surveys are considered and their impact on 0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤ expectations is examined.},

	abstract = {We present an updated global analysis of neutrino oscillation data as of September 2024. The parameters Œ∏12, Œ∏13, \$\$ {\textbackslash}Delta \{m\}\_\{21\}{\textasciicircum}2 \$\$, and \$\$ {\textbackslash}mid {\textbackslash}Delta \{m\}\_\{3{\textbackslash}ell\}{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}mid \$\$(‚Ñì = 1, 2) are well-determined with relative precision at 3œÉ of about 13\%, 8\%, 15\%, and 6\%, respectively. The third mixing angle Œ∏23 still suffers from the octant ambiguity, with no clear indication of whether it is larger or smaller than 45¬∞. The determination of the leptonic {CP} phase Œ¥{CP} depends on the neutrino mass ordering: for normal ordering the global fit is consistent with {CP} conservation within 1œÉ, whereas for inverted ordering {CP}-violating values of Œ¥{CP} around 270¬∞ are favored against {CP} conservation at more than 3.6œÉ. While the present data has in principle 2.5‚Äì3œÉ sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering, there are different tendencies in the global data that reduce the discrimination power: T2K and {NOvA} appearance data individually favor normal ordering, but they are more consistent with each other for inverted ordering. Conversely, the joint determination of \$\$ {\textbackslash}mid {\textbackslash}Delta \{m\}\_\{3{\textbackslash}ell\}{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}mid \$\$from global disappearance data prefers normal ordering. Altogether, the global fit including long-baseline, reactor and {IceCube} atmospheric data results into an almost equally good fit for both orderings. Only when the œá2 table for atmospheric neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande is added to our œá2, the global fit prefers normal ordering with ‚àÜœá2 = 6.1. We provide also updated ranges and correlations for the effective parameters sensitive to the absolute neutrino mass from Œ≤-decay, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and cosmology.},

A Bayesian global fit is performed to construct a probability distribution for the effective Majorana mass, the observable of interest for these experiments. This probability distribution is then combined with the sensitivity of each experiment derived from a heuristic counting analysis. The discovery probability is found to be higher than previously considered, but strongly depends on whether the neutrino mass ordering is normal or inverted. For the inverted ordering, next-generation experiments are likely to observe a signal already during their first operational stages. Even for the normal ordering, in the absence of neutrino mass mechanisms that drive the lightest state or the effective Majorana mass to zero, the probability of discovering neutrinoless double-ùõΩ decay can reach ‚àº50\% or more in the most promising experiments.},

Unlike recent language representation models, {BERT} is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained {BERT} model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. {BERT} is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the {GLUE} score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), {MultiNLI} accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), {SQuAD} v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and {SQuAD} v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

As the field continues to evolve, it is crucial to understand the landscape of highly cited publications to identify key trends, influential authors, and significant contributions made thus far. In this paper, we present a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of highly cited {ML} publications. We collected a dataset consisting of the top-cited papers from reputable {ML} conferences and journals, covering a period of several years from 1959 to 2022. We employed various bibliometric techniques to analyze the data, including citation analysis, co-authorship analysis, keyword analysis, and publication trends. Our findings reveal the most influential papers, highly cited authors, and collaborative networks within the machine learning community. We identify popular research themes and uncover emerging topics that have recently gained significant attention. Furthermore, we examine the geographical distribution of highly cited publications, highlighting the dominance of certain countries in {ML} research. By shedding light on the landscape of highly cited {ML} publications, our study provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to understand the key developments and trends in this rapidly evolving field.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {Deep-learning has proved in recent years to be a powerful tool for image analysis and is now widely used to segment both 2D and 3D medical images. Deep-learning segmentation frameworks rely not only on the choice of network architecture but also on the choice of loss function. When the segmentation process targets rare observations, a severe class imbalance is likely to occur between candidate labels, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In order to mitigate this issue, strategies such as the weighted cross-entropy function, the sensitivity function or the Dice loss function, have been proposed. In this work, we investigate the behavior of these loss functions and their sensitivity to learning rate tuning in the presence of different rates of label imbalance across 2D and 3D segmentation tasks. We also propose to use the class re-balancing properties of the Generalized Dice overlap, a known metric for segmentation assessment, as a robust and accurate deep-learning loss function for unbalanced tasks.},

	abstract = {The highest accuracy object detectors to date are based on a two-stage approach popularized by R-{CNN}, where a classifier is applied to a sparse set of candidate object locations. In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call {RetinaNet}. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, {RetinaNet} is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

Recent work has shown that self-attention is an effective way of modeling textual sequences. In this work, we generalize a recently proposed model architecture based on self-attention, the Transformer, to a sequence modeling formulation of image generation with a tractable likelihood. By restricting the self-attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods we significantly increase the size of images the model can process in practice, despite maintaining significantly larger receptive fields per layer than typical convolutional neural networks. While conceptually simple, our generative models significantly outperform the current state of the art in image generation on {ImageNet}, improving the best published negative log-likelihood on {ImageNet} from 3.83 to 3.77. We also present results on image super-resolution with a large magnification ratio, applying an encoder-decoder configuration of our architecture. In a human evaluation study, we find that images generated by our super-resolution model fool human observers three times more often than the previous state of the art.},

	abstract = {We report the development of {GPT}-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, {GPT}-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. {GPT}-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of {GPT}-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of {GPT}-4.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1607.06450},
	abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

	abstract = {The Dice similarity coefficient ({DSC}) is both a widely used metric and loss function for biomedical image segmentation due to its robustness to class imbalance. However, it is well known that the {DSC} loss is poorly calibrated, resulting in overconfident predictions that cannot be usefully interpreted in biomedical and clinical practice. Performance is often the only metric used to evaluate segmentations produced by deep neural networks, and calibration is often neglected. However, calibration is important for translation into biomedical and clinical practice, providing crucial contextual information to model predictions for interpretation by scientists and clinicians. In this study, we provide a simple yet effective extension of the {DSC} loss, named the {DSC}++ loss, that selectively modulates the penalty associated with overconfident, incorrect predictions. As a standalone loss function, the {DSC}++ loss achieves significantly improved calibration over the conventional {DSC} loss across six well-validated open-source biomedical imaging datasets, including both 2D binary and 3D multi-class segmentation tasks. Similarly, we observe significantly improved calibration when integrating the {DSC}++ loss into four {DSC}-based loss functions. Finally, we use softmax thresholding to illustrate that well calibrated outputs enable tailoring of recall-precision bias, which is an important post-processing technique to adapt the model predictions to suit the biomedical or clinical task. The {DSC}++ loss overcomes the major limitation of the {DSC} loss, providing a suitable loss function for training deep learning segmentation models for use in biomedical and clinical practice.

	abstract = {Simultaneous segmentation of multiple organs from different medical imaging modalities is a crucial task as it can be utilized for computer-aided diagnosis, computer-assisted surgery, and therapy planning. Thanks to the recent advances in deep learning, several deep neural networks for medical image segmentation have been introduced successfully for this purpose. In this paper, we focus on learning a deep multi-organ segmentation network that labels voxels. In particular, we examine the critical choice of a loss function in order to handle the notorious imbalance problem that plagues both the input and output of a learning model. The input imbalance refers to the class-imbalance in the input training samples (i.e., small foreground objects embedded in an abundance of background voxels, as well as organs of varying sizes). The output imbalance refers to the imbalance between the false positives and false negatives of the inference model. In order to tackle both types of imbalance during training and inference, we introduce a new curriculum learning based loss function. Specifically, we leverage Dice similarity coefficient to deter model parameters from being held at bad local minima and at the same time gradually learn better model parameters by penalizing for false positives/negatives using a cross entropy term. We evaluated the proposed loss function on three datasets: whole body positron emission tomography ({PET}) scans with 5 target organs, magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) prostate scans, and ultrasound echocardigraphy images with a single target organ i.e., left ventricular. We show that a simple network architecture with the proposed integrative loss function can outperform state-of-the-art methods and results of the competing methods can be improved when our proposed loss is used.},

Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of neutrino oscillations, we know that neutrinos have non-zero mass. However, the absolute neutrino-mass scale remains unknown. Here we report the upper limits on effective electron anti-neutrino mass, mŒΩ, from the second physics run of the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment. In this experiment, mŒΩ is probed via a high-precision measurement of the tritium Œ≤-decay spectrum close to its endpoint. This method is independent of any cosmological model and does not rely on assumptions whether the neutrino is a Dirac or Majorana particle. By increasing the source activity and reducing the background with respect to the first physics campaign, we reached a sensitivity on mŒΩ of 0.7‚Äâ{eV}‚Äâc‚Äì2‚Äâat a 90\% confidence level ({CL}). The best fit to the spectral data yields \$\$\{\{{\textbackslash}mbox\{\}\}\}\{m\}\_\{{\textbackslash}nu \}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\{\{{\textbackslash}mbox\{\}\}\}\$\$‚Äâ=‚Äâ(0.26‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.34)‚Äâ{eV}2‚Äâc‚Äì4, resulting in an upper limit of mŒΩ‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.9‚Äâ{eV}‚Äâc‚Äì2‚Äâat 90\% {CL}. By combining this result with the first neutrino-mass campaign, we find an upper limit of mŒΩ‚Äâ{\textless}‚Äâ0.8‚Äâ{eV}‚Äâc‚Äì2 at 90\% {CL}.},

	abstract = {We present a joint analysis of the Planck cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey ({BOSS}) final data releases. A key novelty of our study is the use of a new full-shape ({FS}) likelihood for the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum of the {BOSS} data, based on an improved perturbation theory template. We show that the addition of the redshift-space galaxy clustering measurements breaks degeneracies present in the {CMB} data alone and tightens constraints on cosmological parameters. Assuming the minimal Œõ‚Å¢{CDM} cosmology with massive neutrinos, we find the following late-Universe parameters: the Hubble constant ùêª0=67.9‚Å¢5+0.66‚àí0.52 km s‚àí1 Mpc‚àí1, the matter density fraction Œ©ùëö =0.307‚Å¢9+0.0065‚àí0.0085, the mass fluctuation amplitude ùúé8=0.808‚Å¢7+0.012‚àí0.0072, and an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses ùëÄtot {\textless}0.16 {eV} (95\% C.L.). This can be contrasted with the Planck-only measurements: ùêª0=67.1‚Å¢4+1.3‚àí0.72 km s‚àí1 Mpc‚àí1, Œ©ùëö=0.318‚Å¢8+0.0091‚àí0.016, ùúé8=0.805‚Å¢3+0.019‚àí0.0091, and ùëÄtot {\textless}0.26 {eV} (95\% C.L.). Our bound on the sum of neutrino masses relaxes once the hierarchy-dependent priors from the oscillation experiments are imposed. The addition of the new {FS} likelihood also constrains the effective number of extra relativistic degrees of freedom, ùëÅeff =2.88 ¬±0.17. Our study shows that the current {FS} and the pure baryon acoustic oscillation data add a similar amount of information in combination with the Planck likelihood. We argue that this is just a coincidence given the {BOSS} volume and efficiency of the current reconstruction algorithms. In the era of future surveys {FS} will play a dominant role in cosmological parameter measurements.},

	abstract = {Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics explain the dominance of matter over antimatter in our Universe by neutrinos being their own antiparticles. This would imply the existence of neutrinoless double-Œ≤ decay, which is an extremely rare lepton-number-violating radioactive decay process whose detection requires the utmost background suppression. Among the programmes that aim to detect this decay, the {GERDA} Collaboration is searching for neutrinoless double-Œ≤ decay of 76Ge by operating bare detectors, made of germanium with an enriched 76Ge fraction, in liquid argon. After having completed Phase I of data taking, we have recently launched Phase {II}. Here we report that in {GERDA} Phase {II} we have achieved a background level of approximately 10‚àí3 counts {keV}‚àí1 kg‚àí1 yr‚àí1. This implies that the experiment is background-free, even when increasing the exposure up to design level. This is achieved by use of an active veto system, superior germanium detector energy resolution and improved background recognition of our new detectors. No signal of neutrinoless double-Œ≤ decay was found when Phase I and Phase {II} data were combined, and we deduce a lower-limit half-life of 5.3‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ1025 years at the 90 per cent confidence level. Our half-life sensitivity of 4.0‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ1025 years is competitive with the best experiments that use a substantially larger isotope mass. The potential of an essentially background-free search for neutrinoless double-Œ≤ decay will facilitate a larger germanium experiment with sensitivity levels that will bring us closer to clarifying whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles.},

    abstract = {In the crystal bulk of group IV covalent semiconductors such as germanium (Ge), simple analytic models for the valence band structure can provide fast, accurate computations of hole mobility for moderate energy ranges up to a few eV. On the surfaces of these materials, such as on Ge-vacuum or Ge‚ÄìGeO2 interfaces, the transport rates differ significantly from the bulk. This can be problematic for both point contact and segmented Ge gamma ray detectors, that require accurate carrier drift rates for computing signal basis sets, which themselves are necessary for the precise determination of gamma-ray induced compton scattering events. While several techniques exist for computing surface hole mobilities, more often than not, these methods are complex to implement, require significant computational resources, and lack the simplicity of bulk models for interpreting results. This paper presents a new technique for computing Ge surface hole mobility that can give a first estimate for the surface transport rates after tuning a physically based computational parameter. This model is used in conjunction with particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for modeling hole-dynamics inside a Ge p-type point contact detector. The results of our calculations agree with experimental data gathered from Ge p-type point contact detectors at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.}

It includes complete information on the experimental input data that were used to derive the tables of recommended values which are given in Part II. This article describes the evaluation philosophy and procedures that were implemented in the selection of specific nuclear reaction, decay and mass-spectrometric data which were used in a least-squares fit adjustment in order to determine the recommended mass values and their uncertainties. All input data, including both the accepted and rejected ones, are tabulated and compared with the adjusted values obtained from the least-squares fit analysis. Differences with the previous AME2016 evaluation are discussed and specific examples are presented for several nuclides that may be of interest to AME users.}

abstract = {LEGEND (Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay) is a ton-scale experimental program to search for neutrinoless double beta (0vŒ≤Œ≤) decay using high-purity germanium detectors enriched in the isotope 76Ge. An observation of 0vŒ≤Œ≤ decay would unequivocally prove the existence of lepton number violation and provide insight into the nature of neutrino masses.

On-site construction for the first 200-kg phase (LEGEND-200) of the experiment will start at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory (Laboratory Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy) in mid-2020. In order to achieve a sensitivity of 1027 years on the 0vŒ≤Œ≤ half-life, ultra-clean low-noise signal readout electronics are essential as they impact both the background budget of the experiment and the efficiency of background rejection. In this contribution, the current status of the signal readout electronics for LEGEND-200 is presented.}

abstract = {This paper describes state-of-the-art digital filtering techniques that are part of GEANA, an automatic data analysis software used for the GERDA experiment. The discussed filters include a novel, nonlinear correction method for ballistic deficits, which is combined with one of three shaping filters: a pseudo-Gaussian, a modified trapezoidal, or a modified cusp filter. The performance of the filters is demonstrated with a 762g Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector, produced by Canberra, that measures Œ≥-ray lines from radioactive sources in an energy range between 59.5 and 2614.5keV. At 1332.5keV, together with the ballistic deficit correction method, all filters produce a comparable energy resolution of ~1.61keV FWHM. This value is superior to those measured by the manufacturer and those found in publications with detectors of a similar design and mass. At 59.5keV, the modified cusp filter without a ballistic deficit correction produced the best result, with an energy resolution of 0.46keV. It is observed that the loss in resolution by using a constant shaping time over the entire energy range is small when using the ballistic deficit correction method.}

abstract = {The electron drift in germanium detectors is modeled making many assumptions. Confronted with data, these assumptions have to be revisited. The temperature dependence of the drift of electrons was studied in detail for an n-type segmented point-contact germanium detector.  The detector was mounted in a temperature controlled, electrically cooled cryostat. Surface events were induced with collimated 81 keV photons from a 133Ba source. A detailed analysis of the rise time of pulses collected in surface scans, performed at different temperatures, is presented. The longitudinal anisotropy of the electron drift decreases with rising temperature. A new approach, making use of designated rise-time windows determined by simulations using SolidStateDetectors.jl, was used to isolate the longitudinal drift of electrons along different axes to quantify this observation. The measured temperature dependence of the longitudinal drift velocities combined with the standard electron-drift model as widely used in relevant simulation packages results in unphysical predictions. A modification of the electron-drift model based on assuming phonons to be the dominating scattering centers for electrons is motivated and described. The results of a first implementation of the modified model in SolidStateDetectors.jl are shown. They describe the temperature dependence of the data reasonably well. A general review of the model and the standard input values for mobilities is suggested.}
