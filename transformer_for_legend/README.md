# Transformer Encoder for Pulse Shape Discrimination

This module implements an **encoder-only Transformer** architecture, following the design of [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), but adapted to one-dimensional time-series data.  

**Important note:**  
The **original implementation** of this Transformer was written by **Marta Babicz** and is hosted in a **private GitHub repository**. Due to authorship restrictions, the original code cannot be distributed here. I have adapted parts of the implementation for integration into this project. However, the **core implementation** remains authored by **Marta Babicz** and is not included in this repository.

## Accessing the Code

- Original repository link: [transformer-for-legend](https://github.com/mababicz/transformer_for_legend) *(private access required)*

## Usage in This Project

This repository uses the Transformer model training and evaluation. Since the original implementation is not public:

- You may replace it with an **open-source Transformer** (e.g., [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)) for reproduction.
